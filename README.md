# 6T-SRAM-Cell-Pre-and-Post-Layout-Simulation
Pre-layout and post-layout simulation of a 6T SRAM cell using open-source EDA tools. This project covers schematic design, SPICE simulation, physical layout in Magic VLSI, parasitic extraction, and verification. Includes waveform analysis for read/write operations, comparison between ideal (pre-layout) and realistic (post-layout with parasitics).
