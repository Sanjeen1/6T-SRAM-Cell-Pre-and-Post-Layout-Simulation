# 6T-SRAM-Cell-Pre-and-Post-Layout-Simulation
Pre-layout and post-layout simulation of a 6T SRAM cell using open-source EDA tools. This project covers schematic design, SPICE simulation, physical layout in Magic VLSI, parasitic extraction, and verification. Includes waveform analysis for read/write operations, comparison between ideal (pre-layout) and realistic (post-layout with parasitics).

# 6T-SRAM-Cell-Pre-and-Post-Layout-Simulation

This repository contains the design, simulation, and verification of a **6T SRAM Cell** using open-source EDA tools.  
The project demonstrates the complete flow from schematic design to layout verification, including **pre-layout** and **post-layout simulations**.

## üìå Project Overview

The 6T SRAM cell is one of the most fundamental building blocks in memory design.  
In this project, the following steps are carried out:

1. **Schematic Design**  
   - Creation of the 6T SRAM schematic.
   - Verification of read and write operations using **LTSpice/Ngspice**.

2. **Pre-layout Simulation**  
   - SPICE simulations performed without considering layout parasitics.
   - Captures the ideal behavior of the SRAM cell.

3. **Physical Layout Design**  
   - Layout created in **Magic VLSI** using **TSMC 180nm technology file**.
   - Ensures design rule correctness (DRC clean) and layout vs schematic check (LVS clean).

4. **Post-layout Simulation**  
   - Extraction of parasitics using Magic/Ngspice.
   - More realistic simulation considering wire and device parasitics.
   - Comparison of results with pre-layout simulations.
